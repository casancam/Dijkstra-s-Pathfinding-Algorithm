I created this PathFinder algorithm using JavaScript and React by following Clement Mihailescu's tutorial and adding some extra features.

On the visualizer: draw with your mouse walls and click the button to visualize how Dikjstra's algorithm works.

All the algorithm code is inside the src folder.
